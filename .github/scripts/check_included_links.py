"""Refuse a built page that links at `BLOB` a file a docs page includes.

Section 2 of the standard, *The documentation*, is the rule. This reads
the built html for a link `RootFileLinks` left at `BLOB`.

Run from the root of the tree, with the directory the build wrote:

    uv run --no-project --python 3.15 \
        standard/.github/scripts/check_included_links.py docs/build/html

`BLOB` is `[project.urls] repository` of `pyproject.toml` followed by
`/blob/main/`, `conf.py` reading the same key. The included files are
the ones the `docs/source/*.md` pages include, each page holding at most
one include fence whose path is relative to the page. A fence shown in a
code block is text, not an include. Each link found is printed as
`page:line: url`; `main` says what the exit code is.
